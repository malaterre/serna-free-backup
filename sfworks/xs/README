This directory contains source code for the W3C-conformant XML
Schema validator, with numerous extensions (documented in the
SRS document). The source code structure is as follows:

xs/		- top-level validator code and interface headers
xs/papers	- XSV-related papers, original documentation and
		  Doxygen documentation-generation templates
xs/parser	- source code for the Schema parser
xs/components	- source code for the Schema components
xs/complex	- source code for the complex types validation
xs/datatypes	- source code for atomic and simple type validation
xs/doc		- Windoze word docs (barf)

This XSV implementation also uses certain other modules:

sfworks/grove	- XML grove implementation
sfworks/uri	- URI mapper/manager

It also uses Qt-2.2.4 third party library, and (optionally) SP-1.1.3
library.
