This is the implementation (library-compiled) part of the foundation
library.

This implementation uses certain files from the Qt distribution
(required Qt3.0.0 or later). They are included.

Sometimes you need to use common library with other different
version of Qt. To do so, you must recompile common library
as follows:

- unpack Qt distribution somewhere

- update Qt qshared.h header (replace it with thread-safe version):
  cp qshared.h qt/src/tools
  (this step is necessary if you want to work with original QStrings
   in thread-safe manner as well)
  You may then rebuild Qt itself with updated header.

- run gmake QTDIR=<qt_path> EOL=<eol_path>
  where QTDIR a the path to the unpacked Qt distribution, and
  EOL is the path to the EOL source tree.
  (alternatively, you may set QTDIR and EOL environment variables)

gmake will build static library (libcommon.a) by default. This library
is not dependent on Qt. If you want shared library, set variable STATIC
to 0.

If you application uses Qt itself, then you may wish to avoid code
duplication. To do so, remove qtools.cxx from the sources list in
Makefile (you must then link with the Qt library).
