DITA OT release 1.2
Available since Feb. 23, 2006

DITA open toolkit Release 1.2 is a major release to add new functions, fulfill new requirements, make some function enhancements and fix bugs over release 1.1.2.1.

DITA-OT 1.2 Important Change
DITA-OT 1.2 offers new error handling and logging system. If you invoke your transformation by using java command line where new error handling and logging system is mandatory, you need to set the CLASSPATH Environment Variable to include dost.jar. If you invoke your transformation by using an ant script, you need to do one more step after the setting above. That is adding a parameter in your command to invoke an ant script. For example, use ant -f ant\sample_xhtml.xml -logger org.dita.dost.log.DITAOTBuildLogger instead of ant -f ant\sample_xhtml.xml to start a transformation defined in ant script file ant\sample_xhtml.xml.

[7 Function Enhancements]
1. New plugin archiecture
2. Transformation to wordrtf
3. HTML to DITA migration tool
4. Problem determination and log analysis

DITA OT release 1.1.2.1
Available since Nov. 10, 2005

Release 1.1.2.1 is a full build to provide an urgent fix to fix the following critical problem which users found in release 1.1.2.
1. SF Bug 1345600  The build process failed when run "Ant all" in release 1.1.2

For this fix, we have restored all the source DITA files in 'doc' and directories in the binary packages.

Note that the original parameter "args.eclipse.toc" in "Ant tasks and script" was separated to "args.eclipsehelp.toc" for DITA-to-Eclipse help transformation, and "args.eclipsecontent.toc" for DITA-to-dynamic Eclipse content transformation.

Another issue is that we found there is a mismatch in the document and the toolkit behavior when you are trying to use the following command 
   ant -f conductor.xml -propertyfile ${dita.temp.dir}/property.temp. 
Now we have updated the documentation. Please refer to the topic 'Building DITA output with Java command line' on our website for more details.

These updates do not affect standard operation of the toolkit. The main goal of this minor release to enable new users of the toolkit to run the installation verification tests without failure.

====================================================================================

DITA Open Toolkit 1.0 is a major upgrade from its predecessor, the developerWorks version known as "dita132." Because this is a new project with a new name. a new home, and largely new code, and because it is considered production-level code for XHTML output, the project numbering has been initiated at 1.0 for the first built release. The 1.0 version of code is still based on the dita132 DTDs and Schemas.

Major improvements from dita132 include:

    * A new processing architecture that includes a new preprocessing stage
    * Full conref resolution in the preprocessor
    * Full conditional resolution (filtering and flagging) in the preprocessor
    * Second pass transformation into final output formats
    * Use of Ant and Java for the processing sequence and utility code
    * A high-quality transform for XHTML output based on code that IBM has tested and used for the past 5 years
    * Translated libraries for generated text in 47 languages (accessed by region and country code)
