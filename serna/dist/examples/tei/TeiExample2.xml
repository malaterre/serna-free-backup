        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>I have endeavoured in this <emph>Ghostly</emph> little book, to raise the <emph>Ghost</emph> of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.</p>

          <head>Marley&apos;s Ghost</head>
          <p>Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge&apos;s name was good upon &apos;Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.</p>
