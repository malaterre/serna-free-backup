  <title>How to Edit Document XML Source</title>
  <body id="body">
    <section>
      <p>It is possible to edit the source of XML document in Serna, i.e. <keyword>edit document as text</keyword>. There are two possible approaches:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Switch to text mode</b>
          <p>Go to <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Switch to Text Mode</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> to edit your whole document as XML source.</p>
          <p>Note, this mode is not recommended for general user, and is intended mostly for fixing XML syntax errors. Use this mode only if you know what you are doing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Edit selection as text</b>
          <p>You can edit the source of only a part of the XML document. For this select the portion you wish to edit, and select <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Edit Selection as Text</uicontrol>
            </menucascade>, <keyword>Edit Selection as Text Dialog</keyword> will appear.</p>
          <p>If you make a syntactic error while editing the selected portion, Serna will signal error and refuse to  accept the changes you have made.</p>
