  <title>Working with XInclude</title>

    <section>
      <p><term>XInclude</term> is a mechanism that allows you to aggregate several standalone XML documents into your document. In general XInclude is very similar to <keyword>external entities</keyword> , but there are two major differences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>External entities are not self-contained. Within an external entity it is not possible to define DOCTYPE     as well as local internal or external entities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>External entities  are always included as a whole.  In contrast, when xincluding you may  merge only a portion of the xincluded document (referenced by XPointer).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>See <xref href="../developers_guide/xinclude-support.xml"/> for more details on the XInclude standard support.</p>
