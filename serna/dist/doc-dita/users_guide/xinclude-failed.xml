  <title>How to Find out Why My XInclude Failed?</title>
  <body id="body">
    <section>
      <p>If you see  black empty xinclude brackets or you see a fallback element instead of your xincluded document, it means that for some reason Serna could not locate the  file you wanted to xinclude. To find out the reason, put a cursor in the brackets and select <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Entity</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Current XInclude Status...</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>. Detailed status and error report will be shown.</p>
