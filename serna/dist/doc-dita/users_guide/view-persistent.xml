      <title>Abstract</title>
      <p>Suppose you have customized and tailored the Serna view to your needs. You might have changed the GUI layout, plugin settings, etc. However, if you want the customizations to be permanent, you must save them.</p>
      <p>In this chapter you will learn how to make the customized Serna view settings persistent so that they will work with any document opened with  a particular template or will work as the no-template view. </p>
      <p>To learn more about the views, see  <xref href="views.xml"/> and  <xref href="view-activation-priority.xml"/>. </p>
