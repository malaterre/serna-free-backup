  <title>XSL-FO Support</title>

      <note>
        <p>The primary goal of Serna is to be a highly customizable XML WYSIWYG editor that renders documents according to XSL stylesheets. Therefore complete support of XSLT/XSL-FO is not the primary goal. Rather, it is important to support XSLT/XSL-FO to the extent that makes authoring smooth and convenient.</p>
        <p>Note, however, that Syntext <b>does </b>intend to widen XSLT/XSL-FO support in the subsequent releases.</p>

      </note>
      <p>Syntext Serna dynamic XSL-FO implementation is based on  the <xref href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xsl-20011015" format="html">Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) Version 1.0 W3C Recommendation, 15 October 2001</xref> except as noted below.</p>
